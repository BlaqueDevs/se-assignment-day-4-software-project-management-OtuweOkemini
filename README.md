Waterfall methodology empasizes on a more rigid, linear and sequential approach.
Agile methodology encourages quick response to changes, feedback and collaboration but is not easily predictable because the idea can change along the way.
waterfall methodology due to it's rigidity is easy to manage and has clear structure and documentation but has difficulty accommodating changes.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

This can help because when you know the cause of a problem it is easier to compile market data, user pain points or industry reports on effective solutions.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
This can be done by providing a high level overview of the solutions.
also by highlighting the features and functionalities that make the solution effective.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
A detailed outline of the primary features and their specific benefits, use of concrete examples or scenarios, quotes and testimonials from early users.


## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
The use of current statistics can help provide knowledge on the currrent market size and projected growth.


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
